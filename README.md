# Ansible
Ansible is an open-source automation tool that allows you to automate various IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and infrastructure provisioning. It provides a simple and powerful way to automate repetitive tasks, streamline complex workflows, and manage infrastructure as code.

With Ansible, you can define your infrastructure and application configurations in simple human-readable YAML files called playbooks. Playbooks describe the desired state of your systems and define a series of tasks that Ansible executes on remote hosts. It uses SSH to connect to the remote hosts and perform the necessary configurations or tasks.

Some key features of Ansible include:

- Declarative Configuration Management: Ansible uses a declarative approach, where you define the desired state of the system, and Ansible takes care of bringing the system to that state. You don't need to specify the exact steps to achieve the desired state; Ansible handles it for you.


- Agentless Architecture: Ansible works over SSH and doesn't require any agent software to be installed on the managed hosts. This makes it lightweight and easy to manage.


- Idempotent Execution: Ansible ensures idempotent execution, meaning that running the same playbook multiple times will have the same result. It checks the current state of the system and only applies the necessary changes to reach the desired state.


- Extensibility and Flexibility: Ansible is highly extensible and provides a rich set of modules that cover a wide range of use cases. It also supports custom modules and plugins, allowing you to extend its functionality to meet your specific requirements.


- Multi-Platform Support: Ansible can manage a variety of systems and platforms, including Linux, Windows, macOS, network devices, cloud infrastructure, and more. It provides a unified approach to managing diverse environments.
